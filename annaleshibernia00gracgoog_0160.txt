said to his son that in this way he should save it 101 himself and his children
from the attacks 01 the Irish; his son Henry answered him, “wherever there are
breve men there is acastle, according to tlte sayiny, and there the children 01
101001 pitohed their camp, Ι shall ever be amongst the breve, and therefore in
scastle. Ι had rather, quoth he, have a castle 01 bones than 01 stones.'’ Being
thus deterred, his father, stopping the work he had began, spent his substance
in housekecping, soyiny that his children would be sorry for it; which cameto
pass, for shortly after the lrish wasted the whole country, because it was bare 01
castlcs. Rolreby gave up his office.
