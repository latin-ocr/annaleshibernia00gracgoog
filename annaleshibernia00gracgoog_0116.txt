1325. Richard Ledred, Bishop of Ossory, cited Alice Ketil to clear herself
os heresy3 she was convicted of magio, for it was surely proved that aoertain
demon incubus (named Robin Artisson) had lain with her, to whom she had
offered nine red oooks, at a certain stone bridge at the orosa roads; and also at
prayer time between compline and ourfew, she swept the streete ol Kilkenny
with brooms, and, as she swept, brought the dirt to the house of William Oudaw,
her son, where she said, in conjuratione, “may all the luck of llilkenny come
to this house.” Many other women are found to have been partakers of this
impiety, as Petronilla of Meath, with her daughter Basilia. The bishop imposed
a fine upon her, and compelled her to forewear witchoraft; but afterwards, being
again convicted of the same crime, she fied with Basilia, nor did she ever appear
again after that time. Petronillaos Meatlt is bumed at Kilkenny, and as she was
dying she declared that the before-named William deserved death as much as
she did, for that for a year and a day he had carried round his naked body the
devil’s girdle. Upon this, he was immediately taken by the order of the bishop,

and shut up in prison, where he was detained about two months; there were

assigned to him two servants, who had orders to speak to him only once a day,
and not to eat or drink with him; at last he was set at liberty by the interest os
Arnold Power‚ Seneschall of Kilkenny. But to the same Arnold he gave alarge
sum of money to throw the bishop into prison, which was done, and the bishop
was kept there three months. Amongst the goods ofAlioe was found a Host, on
which the name of the Devil was inscribed, besides a pix and an ointment therein
