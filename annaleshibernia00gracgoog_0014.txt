os Ireland, as confirming, explaining, or contradicting the statements of
the annalist, and occasionally as supplying some of his omissions, will
not be considered altogether useless.

The MS, which is on paper, consistsof thirtyeightsmallfoliopages '

all, except one, written inthe same hand. The regular Annals termi-
nate at 1370, from which date the entries consist chiefly of the Obits
of the Lacys and Burkes from 1326 to 1515, and although in the same
hand, and written with ink of the same colour with the Annals, and
ouried on on the same page, they are entered in a very confused man-
ner; these are followed by the Obits of the Butlers in chronological
order, which are succeeded by the Obits of the Geraldines, in a dif-
ferent hand, and paler ink. The last leaf of the Ms, which has been
misplaced in the binding, gives some account of the Lord Leonard
Gray, Lord Deputy in 1 53 5, and has been restored to its proper chro-
nological place in the printed text.

The reader is requested to correct note q, p, 29, in which the com-
piler of these Annals is accused of having been mistaken in asserting
that Hubert de Burgh was Justiciary of Ireland in 1230. In this
case the mistake was made by the Editor, as it appears from Rot. Pat.
16 Heu. ΙΙΙ. in Tur. Lond. 3 and also from the Book of Howth‚ as

’ quoted by Hanmer, that Hubert de Burgh was Lord Justice of Ire-

landFlldnllrldhy friends the Editor has received much assistance, but

as this assistance cannot be specified in every instance, their names
are omitted lest they should be thought responsible for the mistakes ’
of the Editor; he cannot, however, forbear aeknowledging, that for
the most important notices of Irish topography he is indebted to the

kindness of Mr. John O'Donovan.
