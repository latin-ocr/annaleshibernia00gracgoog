1346. On Palm Sunday, April 9th, Robert Ufford, J usticiary, dics, to the
greatest public joy and applause of all men. The westher instantly changes and
becomes line; his body, enclosed in lead, is carried by his wife to be burded in
England. On the and day of May (on which day in the year before she en-
tered the city in triumph with her husband) she and her attendants fied out of
· it with his corpse, with sorrow, and amidst the clamour¹ of the people; which
thing was noted as 0 prodigy. Sir Roger Darcy is appointed Justiciary for a
time by the counoil. The castles 01 Ley and of Kilmehede are burned in
Apn'l by the Irish. On the 15th of May Sir John Moris comes Justiciary.
On the 23rd of May the Earl of Kildarc is released from prison, having found
twenty-four bailsmen. In June, three hundred at least of the English of Uriel
are slaughtcred by the Ulster men. John Moris is depn'ved of his office in
June, and Sir Walter Birmingham is made Justiciary. A truce is granted 10 the
Earl of Desnrond3 he therefore sails from Youghal with his wife to England,
where he prosecutes his complaint against Ralph Ufford; he was allowed by the
king (from the time when he entered England) twenty shillings every day for
his expenses. Darcy, Justiciary, and the Earl of Kildare, invade O'Morc, who
had burned the 0001100 01 Ley and Kilmehede, and compelled him to submit,
although he resisted obstinately.
